Defining Tribes
===============

Each tribe is bootstrapped with the following scripts:

* ``data/tribes/init.lua``: This file loads all the scripts that define the
  tribes. So, if you add a new tribe or a new unit to a tribe, it needs to be
  listed in this file.
* ``data/tribes/preload.lua``: Provides basic information about all available
  tribes to the game launching screens. The player won't be able to select a
  tribe without it being defined in this file.
* ``data/tribes/<tribe name>.lua``: These scripts tell the engine which units
  belong to each tribe. They also define some global animated images for each
  tribe (flags, borders, roads).
